    Quick benchmark on how to read/write/store your Pandas dataframe if you don't want to read from CSV all the time. Conclusion:

    1. Parquet gives smallest files
    2. Feather has fastest read
    3. HDF5 (no PyTables) has fastest write
    4. Benchmark suspect. Feather throughput exceeds RAID bandwidth.
